# AudioParticlesVRBuilds
Occasional builds of stuff in development

Instructions for current build:

Unzip and run to get going.

Notes:
I don't recommend running full screen, you'll have to kill the task in Task Manager. Keep windowed.

Instructions:

Swipe right, transition to next effect.
Swipe left, transition to previous effect.

Effect #1:
Currently visual only. Not interactive.

Effect #2:
You can reach out and grab the wisps. If you catch one (or more), flick your wrist to release it.

Effect #3:
Left/Right trigger starts drawing. Right grip clears.

Effect #4:
Left/Right trigger emits particles. Swipe up on touchpad does mass repel.  Clicking down touchpad turns on black hole. Use grips on both controllers and move closer/further apart to scale. Moving left controller through particles coalesces. Moving right controller through particles repels. This is the effect currently being worked on.
