# AudioParticlesVRBuilds
Occasional builds of stuff in development

**Instructions for AudioParticlesVR-alpha-v1.0.2:

Unzip and run to get going.

Notes:
I don't recommend running full screen, you'll have to kill the task in Task Manager. Keep windowed.

Instructions:

Swipe right, transition to next effect.
Swipe left, transition to previous effect.

Effect #1:
Currently visual only. Not interactive.

Effect #2:
You can reach out and grab the wisps. If you catch one (or more), flick your wrist to release it.

Effect #3:
Left/Right trigger starts drawing. Right grip clears.

Effect #4:
Left/Right trigger emits particles. Swipe up on touchpad does mass repel.  Clicking down touchpad turns on black hole. Use grips on both controllers and move closer/further apart to scale. Moving left controller through particles coalesces. Moving right controller through particles repels. This is the effect currently being worked on.

**Instructions for AudioParticlesVR-alpha-v1.0.3:

Effect #1:

Trigger activates repel on each controller. It's pressure sensitive, so the harder you press, the bigger the repel.
Touchpad up button turns off the attractors on each hand. Particles will come to rest if you hold it down.

**Instructions for AudioParticlesVR-alpha-v1.0.4:

This should be the last set of instructions I have to write. Ignore what's on the current title screen.

Swipe Right - next effect
Swipe Left - previous effect
Tap controller bottoms together (like Tilt Brush) to enable / disable tooltips. It gives all of the controls for each effect.

Enjoy!
